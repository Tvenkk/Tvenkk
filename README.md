## 😄 About me

🚶 My name is Roman, I am 21 years old, I am a self-taught programmer, engaged in development and layout, practicing every day consolidating his knowledge, as well as learn something new, has passed many courses on different platforms, both paid and free.

⭐ A plan for the near future, learn JS + React, become a good developer and get a job.

🌟 I have a wonderful girlfriend. Have a car and a category B license. Have education as a CNC machine operator.

🎓 From school years I dreamed of becoming a programmer, I tried to go to college for this specialty, but did not pass, and therefore went to study in a similar direction. I tried to start studying HTML and CSS at the age of 15, but it did not work, from that moment on the idea of starting all over again never left me. After almost 5 years I still tried to enter this field again and it worked, and here you are reading my description on my Github profile.

❗ All of my works was stored on my computer locally, but now I've mastered git and put all my work on Github.
