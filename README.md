## 😄 About me

🚶 My name is Roman, I am 20 years old, I have been doing layout for more than 7 months, I practice every day and reinforce my knowledge, I also learn something new.

⭐ Plan for the near future, learn js + react, become a good developer.

🌟 There is a girlfriend, there is a category B license, there is a personal car. Education cnc machine operator.

🎓 From my school days, I dreamed of becoming a programmer, I tried to enter a college as a programmer, but I didn’t pass, I went to study for something similar, I tried to start studying html and css at the age of 15, but nothing came of it, from that moment the thought of starting over never left and here you are reading my description on my github profile.

❗ All of my work was stored on my computer, but now I've mastered git and decided to put all my work on github. 14-15.08.2022.
