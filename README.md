## 😄 About me

🚶 My name is Roman, I am 21 years old, I am studying the profession of QA engineer. I practice every day and consolidate my knowledge, as well as learning something new. At the moment I'm taking a course from SkyPro, before that I was doing self-study of layout.

⭐ My plan for the near future is to complete the QA-enginner course, become a good tester and find a job.

🌟 Have education as a CNC machine operator.

🎓 From school years I dreamed of becoming a programmer, I tried to go to college for this specialty, but did not pass, and therefore went to study in a similar direction. I tried to start studying HTML and CSS at the age of 15, but it did not work, from that moment on the idea of starting all over again never left me. After almost 5 years I still tried to enter this field again and it worked, and here you are reading my description on my Github profile.

❗ All of my works was stored on my computer locally, but now I've mastered git and put all my work on Github.
